# MobileShop
Online Mobile Shopping site

This is a online mobile shopping site made using HTML and CSS. 

The main reason I built this project was to test my own ability on HTML and CSS. It took me almost a week to build this from scratch with the help 
of many youtube tutorials and documentations. Although not perfect, I'm quite happy with the work I have done and the efforts I put into making this
webpage.

It is a responsive webpage for different screen sizes,(not perfectly, been working on it).

It consists of a navbar, products page, exclusive offer section, featured brands section, contact form and a footer.


Finally, if you've taken your time to look at my project, I totally would love to hear your FEEDBACKS on the project.
Thank You.
